1.Explain in brief the need of hive.
Answer:
HiveQL is like SQL based querying language.
100s of lines of complex code in mapreduce can be written in just 4 lines of hiveQL.
It is automatically converted to mapreduce jobs by the execution engine.
Since it follows SQL based queries it is easy to understand and code.
It automatically uses HDFS for storage, but stores all the meta information about database and table in metadata DB locally to Hive.
Hive is most suited for data warehouse applications, where relatively static data is analyzed, fast response times are not required, and when the data is not changing rapidly.
